ServoPlotter
Authon:		Vishwanath

A simple 2D plotter

Required electronics:
1. ATtiny2313
2. MAX232
3. 1uF capacitor X 4
4. 10uF capacitor X 1
5. DB9 female connector
6. USB to serial (in case your computer doesnt have a serial port)
7. 7805 Voltage regulator
8. Power supply (6V - 9V)

Mechanical components:
1. Servo motors X 2
2. Castor wheels
3. Wooden pieces
4. Serclips

Software to be installed (Developers only):
( See links section for websites to get software or help)
1. python
2. numpy
3. scipy
4. wxpython
5.pyserial
6. WinAVR
7. AVR Studio
8. eagle (If you want to edit the schematic)

Usage:
if using through python, just execute the python script. In window, just double click the machine.py scripy. In linux, change to the directory containing the project files and type the following:
$ python machine.py

Note that the software hasn't been tested on linux. It would be great if someone tests it and gives the results

Drawing:
Use ctrl+left click to create new points. Once done, press Write points button and then press Plot button
