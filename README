This project aims to make an ultra low cost 2D plotter. The target cost
is 10$ but considering practical constrains, around 20$ is the best target.

The project is split into the following folders:

data:		Contains the data files for the plotter
firmware:	Contains the firmware files for attiny2313 microcontroller
mechanics:	Contains files to help constructing the mechanical structure
pyservo:	Contains the host side control software
schematic:	The schematic to make the control electronics. It is not necessary
			to make a PCB but a breadboard will also do.

Each folder has a README to help get started.
