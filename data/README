The virtual workspace (The GUI) and the real workspace are linked by the
coordinates file. The data is split into two files, coords.dat and angles.dat.

The coords.dat contains all the reachable coordinates and the angles.dat contains the corresponding angles of the servo motor

The format of coords.dat:
1. Comments start with #
2. The format of coordinate is [coord1, coord2]\n

The format of angles.dat:
1. Comments start with #
2. The format of angles is [ground servo angle, moving servo angle]\n

This format is strict. These files are parsed by parser.py to extract the information.
